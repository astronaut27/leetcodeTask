# Intuition
Given a grid where each cell can either be land (`1`) or water (`0`), the challenge is to find the largest contiguous area of land. This task naturally suggests a graph traversal problem where each piece of land can be treated as a node and connections between adjacent lands as edges. Depth-First Search (DFS) is particularly well-suited for exploring such areas.

# Approach
1. **DFS Traversal**:
    - Iterate through each cell of the grid. When a land cell (`1`) is found, initiate a DFS to explore the entire island.
    - During DFS, mark cells as visited by setting them to `0` to prevent counting them multiple times.
    - Count each cell in the current island using a reference counter passed recursively to accumulate the total area.

2. **Track Maximum Area**:
    - Maintain a variable to track the maximum area found. After each DFS completes, compare the counted area with the current maximum and update if necessary.

3. **Boundary Conditions**:
    - Ensure the DFS does not traverse outside the grid boundaries or revisit water cells or already visited land cells.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid. Each cell is processed once in the worst case.
- **Space complexity**: O(m * n) in the worst case due to the recursion stack, particularly if the grid is filled with land cells.

# Code
```golang
package main

import "fmt"

func maxAreaOfIsland(grid [][]int) int {
    if len(grid) == 0 {
        return 0
    }
    maxArea := 0
    for i := 0; i < len(grid); i++ {
        for j := 0; j < len(grid[0]); j++ {
            if grid[i][j] == 1 {
                area := 0
                dfs(grid, i, j, &area)
                if area > maxArea {
                    maxArea = area
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return maxArea
}

func dfs(grid [][]int, i, j int, area *int) {
    if i < 0 || j < 0 || i >= len(grid) || j >= len(grid[0]) || grid[i][j] == 0 {
        return
    }
    grid[i][j] = 0
    *area++
    dfs(grid, i+1, j, area)
    dfs(grid, i-1, j, area)
    dfs(grid, i, j+1, area)
    dfs(grid, i, j-1, area)
}

func main() {
    grid := [][]int{
        {1, 1, 0, 0, 0},
        {1, 1, 0, 0, 0},
        {0, 0, 0, 1, 1},
        {0, 0, 0, 1, 1},
    }
    fmt.Println("Maximum area of island is:", maxAreaOfIsland(grid))
}
```

### Explanation
- **DFS Function**: Recursively traverses adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) from a starting land cell, marking visited cells and counting the area of the island.
- **Maximum Area Calculation**: After each DFS call, the area of the currently explored island is compared to the maximum area found so far, and the maximum is updated accordingly.
- **Efficiency**: This approach is efficient as it ensures that each cell is visited only once and directly calculates the area without needing additional storage for each island's area.

This solution effectively leverages the DFS technique to explore and measure contiguous areas of land, updating the maximum area found in a straightforward and efficient manner.
