# Intuition
The problem is analogous to determining if all nodes in a graph can be reached from a starting node. Each room has a set of keys to other rooms, and the task is to check if, starting from room 0, you can visit all rooms. This is essentially checking for connectivity in an undirected graph where rooms are nodes and keys represent edges.

# Approach
1. **Graph Traversal Using Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
    - Represent the graph traversal using a stack to implement DFS iteratively. Start from room 0, marking it as visited.
    - Use a map `visit` to keep track of visited rooms to avoid revisiting them and to count how many unique rooms have been visited.

2. **DFS Execution**:
    - Pop the top room from the stack, marking it as the current room.
    - For each key/neighbor in the current room, if it has not been visited, mark it as visited and push it to the stack for future processing.

3. **Check All Rooms Visited**:
    - After the stack is emptied (DFS is complete), check if the number of rooms visited (size of the `visit` map) matches the total number of rooms.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + k), where `n` is the number of rooms and `k` is the total number of keys. Each room and key is processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), due to the storage needed for the `visit` map and the stack, both of which at most contain all the rooms.

### Explanation
- **DFS Mechanism**: The iterative DFS ensures that all rooms reachable from room 0 are visited by traversing through the keys available in each room. Rooms are pushed to and popped from the stack as they are processed.
- **Visit Tracking**: A map `visit` is used not only to track which rooms have been visited but also to prevent cycles and redundant visits, which optimizes the traversal.
- **Completeness Check**: By comparing the size of the `visit` map with the number of rooms, we confirm whether all rooms are accessible from the starting room.

This approach, using DFS with a stack, efficiently explores the room-key network to ensure all areas can be accessed starting from the initial condition (room 0).

# Code
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func canVisitAllRooms(rooms [][]int) bool {
    visit := map[int]bool{0: true} // Start with room 0 as visited
    stack := []int{0} // Stack for DFS, start with room 0

    for len(stack) > 0 {
        node := stack[len(stack)-1] // Current node/room
        stack = stack[:len(stack)-1] // Pop from stack
        for _, neighbor := range rooms[node] { // Explore each key/neighbor
            if !visit[neighbor] { // If this room hasn't been visited
                visit[neighbor] = true // Mark it as visited
                stack = append(stack, neighbor) // Add it to the stack for further exploration
            }
        }
    }
    return len(visit) == len(rooms) // Check if all rooms were visited
}

func main() {
    rooms := [][]int{{1}, {2}, {3}, {}}
    fmt.Println("Can visit all rooms:", canVisitAllRooms(rooms))
}
