# Intuition
The function `findCircleNum` is designed to determine the number of provinces in an area where cities are represented as nodes in a graph and direct connections between them are represented as edges. A province is defined as a group of directly or indirectly connected cities, and the problem is essentially about finding the number of connected components in an undirected graph.

# Approach
1. **Graph Representation**:
    - The cities and their connections are represented in a symmetric adjacency matrix `isConnected`, where `isConnected[i][j] == 1` indicates a direct connection between cities `i` and `j`.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS) Using a Stack**:
    - Iterate through each city to check if it has been visited. If it hasn't, this means we've found a new province.
    - Use a stack to perform a DFS from the unvisited city to mark all cities in the same province as visited.
    - For each city, if it is connected to another city (`connect == 1`) and that city hasn't been visited, push it onto the stack.

3. **Counting Provinces**:
    - Each time a DFS starts from an unvisited city, increment the province count.
    - Continue the DFS until all cities connected to the starting city are marked as visited, ensuring all cities in one province are accounted for before moving to another.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where `n` is the number of cities. In the worst case, every city could be connected to every other city, requiring a full pass through the adjacency matrix.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), primarily for the `visited` array and the stack used in DFS, which in the worst case might contain all the cities.

### Explanation
- **DFS Mechanism**: The use of a stack for DFS instead of recursion helps in manually managing the visitation of nodes, avoiding potential stack overflow issues with recursion in deeper or denser graphs.
- **Visit Tracking**: Nodes are marked as visited when they are processed (popped from the stack), which prevents cities from being revisited and counted multiple times.
- **Provinces Counting**: Each unvisited node triggering a new DFS sequence indicates the discovery of a new province, incrementing the province count.

This solution efficiently maps out and counts connected components in the graph, using iterative depth-first search to navigate through each potential province.

# Code
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func findCircleNum(isConnected [][]int) int {
    n := len(isConnected)
    visited := make([]bool, n)
    var provinces int
    for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
        if !visited[i] {
            provinces++
            stack := []int{i}
            for len(stack) > 0 {
                node := stack[len(stack)-1]
                stack = stack[:len(stack)-1]
                visited[node] = true // Mark the node as visited when popped from the stack
                for neighbor, connect := range isConnected[node] {
                    if connect == 1 && !visited[neighbor] {
                        stack = append(stack, neighbor)
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return provinces
}

func main() {
    isConnected := [][]int{
        {1, 1, 0},
        {1, 1, 0},
        {0, 0, 1},
    }
    fmt.Println("Number of provinces:", findCircleNum(isConnected))
}
