# Intuition
We are given an array `arr` and a starting index. From any index `i`, we can move to `i + arr[i]` or `i - arr[i]`, and we need to determine whether it's possible to reach any index with a value of `0`. This is a classic reachability problem in an implicit graph, where each index is a node, and valid jumps define the edges.

# Approach
We model the array as a graph where each index is a node, and valid jumps from `i` to `i + arr[i]` or `i - arr[i]` are edges. We can use **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to explore all reachable indices from the starting point:
- Use a queue to keep track of nodes to visit.
- Mark visited indices to avoid cycles or redundant processing.
- Stop and return `true` as soon as we encounter an index with value `0`.
- If BFS completes without finding such an index, return `false`.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: $$O(n)$$  
  Each index is visited at most once.

- **Space complexity**: $$O(n)$$  
  For the `visited` array and BFS queue.

# Code
```golang
func canReach(arr []int, start int) bool {
	n := len(arr)
	visited := make([]bool, n)
	queue := []int{start}
	visited[start] = true

	for len(queue) > 0 {
		curr := queue[0]
		queue = queue[1:]

		// Success condition: value at index is 0
		if arr[curr] == 0 {
			return true
		}

		// Try jumping in both directions
		nextPos := []int{curr + arr[curr], curr - arr[curr]}
		for _, next := range nextPos {
			if next >= 0 && next < n && !visited[next] {
				visited[next] = true
				queue = append(queue, next)
			}
		}
	}

	return false
}
```


### Summary
- The problem is best tackled as a BFS traversal of a graph defined implicitly by jump rules.
- By tracking visited positions, we ensure we don't get stuck in cycles or reprocess the same node.
- BFS guarantees that we find the shortest path to a `0`, though the problem only asks for existence, not distance.
