# Intuition
The problem is essentially about evaluating mathematical equations as a graph of ratios. If we treat each variable as a node and each equation as a weighted directed edge (with the ratio as the weight), then the problem of computing the result of a query reduces to finding a path in this graph and multiplying the weights along the path.

# Approach
- We model the input equations as a graph:
    - For an equation `a / b = val`, we add an edge from `a` to `b` with weight `val`, and from `b` to `a` with weight `1/val`.
- For each query, we perform a **DFS** starting from the source node and try to reach the destination node.
    - While traversing, we accumulate the product of weights.
    - If the destination is reached, we return the accumulated product as the answer.
    - If no path exists, return `-1.0`.
- To avoid cycles during DFS, we keep a `visited` map for each query.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: $$O(Q \cdot N)$$  
  Where \( Q \) is the number of queries and \( N \) is the number of equations (or edges). Each DFS traversal in the worst case can visit all nodes.

- **Space complexity**: $$O(N)$$  
  For storing the graph and visited map, where \( N \) is the number of variables and edges.

# Code
```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

// Struct to represent a neighbor with a weight
type neighbor struct {
	node   string
	weight float64
}

func calcEquation(equations [][]string, values []float64, queries [][]string) []float64 {
	// Graph maps each variable to its neighbors and corresponding weights
	graph := make(map[string][]neighbor)

	// Build the graph from equations
	for i, eq := range equations {
		a, b := eq[0], eq[1]
		val := values[i]
		graph[a] = append(graph[a], neighbor{b, val})
		graph[b] = append(graph[b], neighbor{a, 1.0 / val})
	}

	results := make([]float64, 0, len(queries))

	// Handle each query using DFS
	for _, q := range queries {
		start, end := q[0], q[1]
		_, okStart := graph[start]
		_, okEnd := graph[end]
		if !okStart || !okEnd {
			results = append(results, -1.0)
			continue
		}
		visited := make(map[string]bool)
		val, ok := dfs(graph, start, end, 1.0, visited)
		if !ok {
			results = append(results, -1.0)
		} else {
			results = append(results, val)
		}
	}

	return results
}

// DFS traversal to find a path from curr to target and accumulate product
func dfs(graph map[string][]neighbor, curr, target string, acc float64, visited map[string]bool) (float64, bool) {
	if curr == target {
		return acc, true
	}
	visited[curr] = true

	for _, n := range graph[curr] {
		if !visited[n.node] {
			if res, ok := dfs(graph, n.node, target, acc*n.weight, visited); ok {
				return res, true
			}
		}
	}
	return -1.0, false
}
```

### Summary
- This solution effectively transforms algebraic relationships into a graph and performs a search to resolve unknown queries.
- DFS is well-suited here since we are not necessarily interested in the shortest path but any valid path that yields a result.
- The use of bi-directional edges and floating-point weights makes this a robust graph-based approach to the problem.
