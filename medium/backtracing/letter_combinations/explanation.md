# Intuition
Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, the goal is to return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent, akin to the old mobile phone keypads. Each digit maps to a set of letters, and the task is to produce every combination of letters that can be made by pressing the digits in the input string.

# Approach
The problem is ideally suited for a backtracking approach:
1. **Mapping Digits to Letters**: Use a map to associate each digit with its corresponding letters.
2. **Backtracking Function**:
    - If the current string `curr` has a length equal to the input `digits`, it means a complete combination has been formed, so add it to the results.
    - Otherwise, iterate through the letters corresponding to the current digit, append each letter to the current string, and recursively proceed to the next digit.
3. **Starting the Recursion**: Start the backtracking with an empty string and the first digit.
4. **Returning Results**: Collect all combinations formed by the backtracking process and return them.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: O(4^n), where `n` is the length of the input string `digits`. In the worst case, each digit corresponds to 4 letters (e.g., digits 7 or 9), leading to exponential growth in the number of recursive calls.
- **Space complexity**: O(n) for the recursion stack, where `n` is the depth of the recursive call stack, which corresponds to the number of digits in the input.

### Explanation
- **Backtracking**: The `backtrack` function recursively constructs combinations. It adds a letter to `curr` and moves to the next digit until the combination's length matches `digits`.
- **Base Case and Recursive Calls**: The base case checks if the combination is complete (length of `curr` equals length of `digits`) and adds it to the results. The recursive step moves to the next digit and explores further combinations by appending each possible letter.
- **Letter Mapping**: The mapping from digits to letters reflects the layout of letters on old mobile phone keypads, facilitating direct access to possible letters for each digit.

This approach efficiently navigates the solution space, ensuring all combinations are explored without redundancy.

# Code
```go
package main

import "fmt"

var letterMap = map[byte]string{
    '2': "abc",
    '3': "def",
    '4': "ghi",
    '5': "jkl",
    '6': "mno",
    '7': "pqrs",
    '8': "tuv",
    '9': "wxyz",
}

func letterCombinations(digits string) []string {
    if len(digits) == 0 {
        return []string{}
    }
    var ans []string
    backtrack("", 0, digits, &ans)
    return ans
}

func backtrack(curr string, index int, digits string, ans *[]string) {
    if len(curr) == len(digits) {
        *ans = append(*ans, curr)
        return
    }
    letters := letterMap[digits[index]]
    for i := 0; i < len(letters); i++ {
        backtrack(curr+string(letters[i]), index+1, digits, ans)
    }
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(letterCombinations("23")) // ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]
    fmt.Println(letterCombinations(""))   // []
    fmt.Println(letterCombinations("2"))  // ["a","b","c"]
}
```
