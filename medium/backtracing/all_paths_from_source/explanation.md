# Intuition
The task is to find all possible paths from the source node (node 0) to the target node (last node in the list) in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Each node points to certain other nodes, and we need to explore each possibility, which suggests a depth-first search (DFS) approach. Backtracking fits naturally here, allowing us to explore all paths and backtrack when necessary to explore alternative routes.

# Approach
1. **Start from the Node 0**: The path finding starts from node 0 with an initial path containing just this node.
2. **Recursive Backtracking**:
    - If the current node is the target node (last node of the graph), the current path is stored as one of the valid paths.
    - Otherwise, recursively explore each neighbor by extending the current path to include that neighbor.
    - After each recursive call, the path up to the current node remains, ready to explore the next possibility.
3. **Combining Paths**:
    - For each node, gather all paths returned by the recursive calls from its neighbors and combine them into a single list of paths which continue further back up the recursion chain.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(2^N * N), where `N` is the number of nodes in the graph. In the worst case, every node could be connected to every other node, leading to an exponential number of paths, and for each path, we might end up copying the list (taking `O(N)` time).
- **Space Complexity**: O(N * N), where the worst case space usage comes from having `N` recursive calls (depth of recursion stack) and storing up to `N` paths of length `N`.

### Explanation
- **Recursive Function `backtrack`**: This function is designed to handle the exploration of paths recursively. It accumulates the current path until the target node is reached, at which point it returns the path. If not at the target, it continues to explore further by moving to each adjacent node.
- **Handling of Paths**: Each call to `backtrack` returns a list of complete paths from the current node to the target. These paths are aggregated as the recursion unwinds, collecting all valid paths from the start to the target.
- **Initial Call and Path Setup**: The initial call to `backtrack` starts from node 0, setting up the initial path with just this node.

This structured approach, using backtracking, ensures that all paths are explored without revisiting nodes within the same path, suitable for solving problems modeled by a DAG.

# Code
```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Main function to find all paths from source to target
func allPathsSourceTarget(graph [][]int) [][]int {
	return backtrack(0, []int{0}, graph) // Start from node 0 with path [0]
}

// Self-contained Backtracking function
func backtrack(node int, curPath []int, graph [][]int) [][]int {
	// If we reached the end node (n-1), return the current path as a result
	if node == len(graph)-1 {
		return [][]int{append([]int{}, curPath...)} // Copy the path
	}

	var paths [][]int
	// Iterate through all neighbors of the current node
	for _, child := range graph[node] {
		// Recursively call backtrack for the neighbor
		newPaths := backtrack(child, append(curPath, child), graph)
		paths = append(paths, newPaths...) // Add new paths to the overall result
	}
	return paths
}

func main() {
	graph := [][]int{{1, 2}, {3}, {3}, {}}
	fmt.Println("All paths from source to target:", allPathsSourceTarget(graph))
}
