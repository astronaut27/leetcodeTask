# Intuition
The goal is to generate all possible subsets of a given list of integers. This can be done using a backtracking approach where we recursively explore each element of the list, deciding whether to include or exclude it in the current subset.

The recursive approach ensures that we generate all subsets by systematically including or excluding each element, and backtracking allows us to revert to previous states to explore other possibilities.

# Approach
1. **Base Case**:
    - At each step, the current subset `curr` is added to the final answer list `ans` because all intermediate states represent valid subsets.

2. **Recursive Case**:
    - Start iterating over the elements of the array from the current `index`.
    - For each element at position `i`:
        - Include it in the current subset `curr` by appending it.
        - Recursively call the `backtrack` function with the next index (`i+1`) to explore further elements.
        - After the recursive call, backtrack by removing the last element from `curr` to explore other subsets.

3. **Key Insight**:
    - The recursive structure ensures that each subset is generated without duplication.
    - By incrementing `i` on each recursive call, we ensure that no element is used more than once in the same branch of recursion.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: $$O(2^n)$$, where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because each element has two choices: either to be included or excluded, leading to `2^n` subsets.
- **Space Complexity**: $$O(n)$$, due to the recursion stack and the space used to store the intermediate subsets.

### Explanation
- **Backtracking**:
    - At each recursive call, the current subset (`curr`) is added to the final result.
    - The `for` loop explores all elements starting from the current index. Each recursive call adds one element to the current subset and proceeds to the next index.
    - The backtracking step (`curr = curr[:len(curr)-1]`) removes the last element to revert to the previous state, allowing us to explore other combinations.

- **Output**:
    - For `nums = [1, 2, 3]`, the output will be:
      ```
      [[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3], [2], [2, 3], [3]]
      ```

### Complexity
- **Time**: $$O(2^n)$$ subsets are generated.
- **Space**: $$O(n)$$ for the recursion stack and temporary storage of subsets.

This solution effectively generates all subsets using backtracking.

# Code
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func backtrack(curr []int, index int, nums []int, ans *[][]int) {
    // Add the current subset to the result
    *ans = append(*ans, append([]int{}, curr...))

    // Iterate through the elements starting from the current index
    for i := index; i < len(nums); i++ {
        curr = append(curr, nums[i])        // Include the current element in the subset
        backtrack(curr, i+1, nums, ans)     // Recurse with the next index
        curr = curr[:len(curr)-1]           // Backtrack by removing the last element
    }
}

func subsets(nums []int) [][]int {
    var ans [][]int
    backtrack([]int{}, 0, nums, &ans)
    return ans
}

func main() {
    nums := []int{1, 2, 3}
    result := subsets(nums)
    fmt.Println("All subsets:", result)
}
