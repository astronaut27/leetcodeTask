# Intuition
The problem is to efficiently compute the power of a number, `x`, raised to an integer, `n`. Directly multiplying `x` by itself `n` times would be inefficient, especially for large values of `n`. Instead, exponentiation by squaring allows us to compute large powers in logarithmic time by exploiting the properties of exponents.

# Approach
1. **Handle Base Cases**:
    - If `n` is 0, any number to the power of 0 is 1.
    - If `n` is negative, we compute the power for `-n` and then take the reciprocal.

2. **Exponentiation by Squaring**:
    - The main idea is to square the base (`x`), which effectively doubles the exponent in each iteration.
    - If `n` is even, the problem of `x^n` reduces to `(x^2)^(n/2)`.
    - If `n` is odd, it can be written as `x * x^(n-1)`, where `n-1` is even, allowing us to apply the squaring method.
    - Use a loop to repeatedly square the base and halve the exponent until the exponent becomes zero.

3. **Iterative Calculation**:
    - Use a loop where in each iteration, if `n` is odd, multiply the current result by `base`. Then square the `base` and halve `n` until `n` becomes 0.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n), because we halve `n` in each step of the loop.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only use a fixed amount of extra space for the variables.

### Explanation
- **Handling Negative Power**: When `n` is negative, we work with its absolute value but use the reciprocal of `x`, ensuring that the result is computed correctly for negative exponents.
- **Optimization**: By squaring the base and reducing `n` logarithmically, the function efficiently calculates powers without repetitive multiplication.
- **Iterative vs Recursive**: The approach used here is iterative, which avoids potential stack overflow issues that can occur with recursive methods in languages with limited recursion depth.

This approach to calculating powers is both efficient and straightforward, making it suitable for problems involving large computations.

# Code
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func myPow(x float64, n int) float64 {
    if n == 0 {
        return 1 // Any number raised to the power of 0 is 1
    }
    if n < 0 {
        x = 1 / x // If n is negative, take the reciprocal of x
        n = -n    // Make n positive
    }
    result := 1.0
    base := x
	for n > 0 {
        if n%2 == 1 { // If n is odd, multiply the result by the current base
            result *= base
        }
        base *= base // Square the base
        n /= 2        // Halve the exponent
    }
    return result
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println("3^4 =", myPow(3, 4))
    fmt.Println("2^-3 =", myPow(2, -3))
}
