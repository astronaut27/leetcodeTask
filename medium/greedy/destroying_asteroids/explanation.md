# Intuition
The problem is analogous to determining if an entity with a certain initial mass can survive through a sequence of encounters with asteroids of varying masses. In each encounter, the entity can only survive and absorb an asteroid if its current mass is greater than or equal to the asteroid's mass. This setting is similar to making strategic choices in a game where the player must decide the order of operations based on size or magnitude â€” here, absorbing smaller asteroids first to gradually build up mass and tackle larger ones.

# Approach
1. **Sorting**:
    - Sort the array of asteroid masses in ascending order. This ensures that the entity attempts to absorb the smallest asteroids first, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the chances of absorbing larger asteroids later.

2. **Simulation**:
    - Traverse through the sorted list of asteroids. For each asteroid, check if the current mass of the entity is at least as much as the asteroid's mass.
    - If the entity's mass is sufficient, absorb the asteroid by adding its mass to the entity's current mass.
    - If the entity encounters an asteroid that it cannot absorb (i.e., the asteroid's mass is greater than the entity's current mass), return `false` indicating failure to destroy all asteroids.

3. **Conclusion**:
    - If the entity successfully absorbs all asteroids in the list, return `true`.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where `n` is the number of asteroids. This complexity arises from sorting the asteroids, which dominates the overall time complexity. The subsequent linear scan of the asteroid list is O(n).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), assuming that sorting is done in-place. No additional space proportional to the input size is required beyond constant space for tracking the current mass and iteration indices.


## Explanation
- **Optimal Strategy**: Sorting the asteroids ensures that the entity tackles obstacles from the easiest (smallest) to the hardest (largest), allowing for gradual growth and maximizing survival odds.
- **Iteration and Absorption**: Each asteroid's mass is considered in the smallest-to-largest order. If at any point the entity's mass is insufficient, the function immediately returns `false`. If all asteroids can be absorbed, it indicates that the initial mass was sufficient to handle all encounters in the optimal order.
- **Edge Cases**: For cases where no asteroids exist, the function would trivially return `true` since there are no challenges to overcome. This is implicitly handled by the nature of the for loop and initial conditions.

This approach efficiently determines the entity's ability to survive and grow through successive challenges, providing a clear yes/no answer based on strategic mass accumulation.

# Code
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sort"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println(asteroidsDestroyed(10, []int{3, 9, 19, 5, 21})) // true
	fmt.Println(asteroidsDestroyed(5, []int{4, 9, 23, 4}))      // false
}

func asteroidsDestroyed(mass int, asteroids []int) bool {
	sort.Ints(asteroids) // Sort asteroids by mass in ascending order
	currMass := mass
	for _, a := range asteroids {
		if a > currMass {
			return false // Cannot absorb this asteroid, game over
		}
		currMass += a // Absorb the asteroid and increase the mass
	}
	return true // Successfully absorbed all asteroids
}
