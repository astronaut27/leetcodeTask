# Intuition
The problem asks for finding the minimum falling path sum in a matrix where each element represents a cost of moving through that cell. A falling path starts from any cell in the first row and moves to the next row to one of the adjacent columns (directly below, left diagonal, or right diagonal). The goal is to calculate the minimum sum of such a path from top to bottom.

Initially, I thought of using dynamic programming (DP) because this problem exhibits optimal substructure. The value at each cell depends on the previous row, and we want to minimize the cost for each cell while traversing the matrix.

# Approach
We can use dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum falling path sum for each cell. We define `dp[row][col]` as the minimum sum to reach cell `(row, col)`.

### Steps:
1. **Initialization**: Create a `dp` table with the same dimensions as the matrix. Initially, set each value to a large number except the first row, which will be the same as the matrix's first row.

2. **Recurrence Relation**: For each cell `(row, col)` starting from the second row, the cost to reach that cell is the value of `matrix[row][col]` plus the minimum of the three possible cells from the previous row: directly above `(row-1, col)`, left diagonal `(row-1, col-1)`, and right diagonal `(row-1, col+1)`.

3. **Result**: The result will be the minimum value in the last row of the `dp` table, which gives the minimum falling path sum from the first row to the last.

### Why DP?
This is a classical dynamic programming problem because each subproblem (calculating the path sum to a specific cell) depends only on previously solved subproblems. By solving the problem in a bottom-up manner, we avoid redundant calculations.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: $$O(m \times n)$$
    - We iterate over each cell in the matrix and compute the minimum for each cell using constant time operations.

- **Space complexity**: $$O(m \times n)$$
    - We maintain a 2D `dp` array of the same size as the input matrix.

# Code
```golang
func minFallingPathSum(matrix [][]int) int {
    m, n := len(matrix), len(matrix[0])+1
    
    // Initialize dp table with boundary values set to a large number
    dp := make([][]int, m)
    for i := 0; i < m; i++ {
        dp[i] = make([]int, n+1)
        dp[i][0], dp[i][n] = 10000, 10000 // Set boundaries to a large number (since we're looking for the minimum)
    }
    
    // Initialize the first row of dp
    for j := 1; j < n; j++ {
        dp[0][j] = matrix[0][j-1]
    }

    // Fill the dp table row by row
    for row := 1; row < m; row++ {
        for col := 1; col < n; col++ {
            dp[row][col] = min(min(dp[row-1][col], dp[row-1][col-1]), dp[row-1][col+1]) + matrix[row][col-1]
        }
    }

    // Find the minimum value in the last row of dp
    result := 10000
    for j := 1; j < n; j++ {
        result = min(dp[m-1][j], result)
    }

    return result
}

// Helper function to find the minimum of two numbers
func min(a, b int) int {
    if a < b {
        return a
    }
    return b
}
